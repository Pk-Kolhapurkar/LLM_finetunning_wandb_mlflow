We are given three code snippets that demonstrate the use of MLflow for tracking and managing different aspects of generative AI and LangChain applications.
### Code 1: LangChain Model Logging and Invocation (without RAG)
This code logs a simple LangChain chain (prompt -> LLM -> output parser) to MLflow and then loads it for inference.
**Key Steps:**
1. **Setup**: Load environment variables and set MLflow tracking URI and experiment.
2. **Autologging**: Enable `mlflow.langchain.autolog()` to automatically log LangChain components.
3. **Model Definition**: 
   - Define a prompt template (`template_instruction`) for a sous chef preparing mise-en-place.
   - Create a chain: `prompt | ChatOpenAI (gpt-3.5-turbo) | StrOutputParser`.
4. **Logging the Model**: 
   - In `log_langchain_model()`, the chain is logged using `mlflow.langchain.log_model`.
   - The function returns model info (run ID and model URI).
5. **Loading and Invoking the Model**: 
   - In `load_langchain_model_and_invoke()`, the model is loaded by its URI and then invoked with a recipe and customer count.
**Main Block**: 
   - The code can either log a new model (commented) or load an existing one (by providing the model URI) and invoke it.
### Code 2: LangChain RAG Model Logging and Invocation
This code logs a more complex LangChain RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chain to MLflow and then loads it for inference.
**Key Steps:**
1. **Setup**: Similar to Code 1, but for a different experiment.
2. **Retriever Setup**: 
   - `get_pinecone_as_retriever` sets up a Pinecone vector store as a retriever using HuggingFace embeddings.
   - The retriever uses MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance) for search.
3. **RAG Chain Definition**:
   - Define a system prompt and a human prompt for the question-answering task.
   - Create a `create_stuff_documents_chain` that uses the LLM and prompt to process retrieved documents.
   - Create a `retrieval_chain` that combines the retriever and the document chain.
4. **Logging the RAG Model**:
   - The `log_rag_chain_model` function logs the retrieval chain. Note the use of `loader_fn=load_retriever` which is a function that returns the retriever. This is important for loading the model later because the retriever might have external dependencies (like Pinecone index).
5. **Loading and Invoking the RAG Model**:
   - The `load_rag_model_and_invoke` function loads the model by URI and invokes it with a question.
**Main Block**: 
   - Similar to Code 1, it can log a new model or load an existing one for inference.
### Code 3: Using MLflow Tracing with OpenAI
This code demonstrates the use of MLflow's tracing feature to log detailed information about an OpenAI chat completion call.
**Key Steps:**
1. **Setup**: Load environment variables and set MLflow tracking URI and experiment.
2. **Autologging**: Enable `mlflow.openai.autolog()` to automatically log OpenAI calls.
3. **Tracing**:
   - The function `enhanced_chat_completion` is decorated with `@mlflow.trace`.
   - Within the function, we update the current trace with context (tags like application, user_type, etc.).
   - We then call the OpenAI API to get a chat completion.
   - After the call, we update the trace with performance metrics (response time, token count, model used).
4. **Main Block**:
   - The function is called with a user message and an empty conversation history.
### Key Differences and Features:
1. **Model Complexity**:
   - Code 1: Simple LangChain chain (prompt -> LLM -> output parser).
   - Code 2: More complex RAG chain (retriever -> document chain).
   - Code 3: Direct OpenAI call with tracing.
2. **MLflow Features**:
   - Code 1 and 2: Use `mlflow.langchain` to log and load LangChain models. This is useful for deploying LangChain chains.
   - Code 3: Uses `mlflow.openai.autolog` and the new tracing feature to log detailed information about an OpenAI call, including performance metrics and custom tags.
3. **Artifacts and Dependencies**:
   - In Code 2, when logging the RAG model, we provide a `loader_fn` (which returns the retriever) because the retriever (Pinecone) has external state (the index). This ensures that when the model is loaded, the retriever is properly initialized.
4. **Tracing**:
   - Code 3 demonstrates the use of MLflow tracing to capture not just the inputs and outputs, but also the context and performance of the call. This is especially useful for debugging and monitoring in production.
### Common Patterns:
- All three codes set the MLflow tracking URI and experiment name.
- They all use environment variables for configuration (via `dotenv`).
- They all use MLflow to log or trace interactions with LLMs.
### Summary:
- **Code 1**: Logs and loads a simple LangChain chain for a specific task (recipe preparation).
- **Code 2**: Logs and loads a RAG chain that uses Pinecone for retrieval and then answers questions.
- **Code 3**: Uses MLflow tracing to monitor and log an OpenAI chat completion call with custom context and performance metrics.
These examples show how MLflow can be used for different scenarios in the GenAI lifecycle, from simple chains to complex RAG applications and direct API calls with tracing.
